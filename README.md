Homework 3: Password Generator

This website allows a user to generate a password to their liking. They can select how many characters they want and they can choose what type of characters they want in their password.


* index.html displays all the website content needed for a user.
* style.css displays all the css needed to build the front end along side with bootstrap
* script.js holds all the logic that generates a password that the user wants
* form_input.js holds all the extra logic that manipulates the form to solve boundary cases (eg. You can only type an integer in the Password Length form)
